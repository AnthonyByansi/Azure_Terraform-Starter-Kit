Whether you're new to Terraform or aiming to enhance your existing skills, this Starter Kit offers you a collection of carefully curated scripts, best practices, and industry insights to help you succeed.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Configure Azure Credentials:** Configure your Azure credentials using environment variables, a service principal, or Managed Identity. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create resources in the target Azure subscription.

3. **Customize Variables:** Review the variables in `variables.tf` and adjust them according to your project's requirements. You can also modify the `terraform.tfvars` file with specific values.

4. **Initialize Terraform:** Run `terraform init` to initialize the project. This downloads the necessary providers and prepares your environment.

5. **Deploy Resources:** Execute `terraform apply` to create the defined Azure resources. Review the plan and confirm the deployment.
